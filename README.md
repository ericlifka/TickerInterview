Stock Ticker Interview Problem

The provided StockTicker module emits stock changes. Write a simple dynamic webpage that listens for these events and displays them. A simple solution will show all events in an expanding list, while a more robust solution will keep a single entry for each stock and update it as events come in. Bonus points for adding visual effects to stocks as they change, such as colors to indicate if a stock increased or decreased, or moving relative positions to indicate what event happened most recently.

A straightforward solution to the problem should be achievable within a 1-2 hour time frame. For candidates who don't have strong javascript skills some time for research while working on the problem should also be expected.

Candidates should feel free to add any javascript tools or frameworks they feel would help them, there are no wrong approaches as far as this problem is concerned.

Solutions can be submitted as either PRs to this github repository or by zipping the entire solution folder and emailing it back to your recruiter point of contact.
